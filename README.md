# maimai-webcon

A Virtual Controller designed for Maimai, except it runs on an iPad and connects to a python server that runs on your PC

## Connection Note

The touch device has to be on the same network as the PC you plan to run this on.
It will also inherit lag from the network, so it is recommended to use ethernet where possible.

## Security Note

Please only use this on a known secure network, and only run when necessary.
This application does not currently have any inbuilt security and is not a planned feature that is work in progress.
